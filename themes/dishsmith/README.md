For my wife, Becky :-)

DishSmith is a meal planner created at [HACT 2013](http://hact.org.au) hackathon in a 32 hour programming sprint.

## What is it?

DishSmith lets you organise your life for eating. It is a meal planner based on the premise that eating right requires either **passion** or **planning**.

You add your favourite Dishes and Ingredients needed for those dishes. DishSmith will *pepper* these dishes in to a weekly timetable.

You can even print a shopping list to be used at the beginning of each week.

## Made in Australia

DishSmith is made using [October CMS](http://octobercms.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

## Plugin dependancy

DishSmith comes with its own Plugin for October CMS.
You can find this plugin at the [dishsmith-plugin repo](https://github.com/daftspunk/dishsmith-plugin).
