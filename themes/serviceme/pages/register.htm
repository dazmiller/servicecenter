                    <p class="mbottom20">Creating an account is quick and easy, and will allow you to request services
                        from companies and regain your time and life. You can save your information and have it
                        automatically sent for the application process, saving your repeating your information time and
                        again, and much more. Go on.</p>

                        <b>WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH MY INFORMATION?</b>
                    </div>
                    <p class="mbottom20">We promise that we are a business that is 'for' you, the customer. We have no interest in
                        sharing your information with anyone you dont want us to. This is how our business works and we wont risk
                        loosing your trust just to make a quick buck. Nowdays security and trust are words that are thrown around
                        to easily and we believe its time to once again make these words something you can write in stone and depend upon.</p>

                        <b>WHY DO YOU WANT THIS INFORMATION ABOUT ME?</b>
                    </div>
                    <p class="mbottom20">Everybody remembers their email address. Its a simple way to remember your login instead
                        of having to remember a UserName for this site. Also, your email address is unique already, ie nobody else has it
                        where-as often when you have to create a UserName, you will find that the name you want may be taken and you end up
                        creating something hard to remember like User12xx just to get past the account validation. We want you to easily access
                        your information and use this tool for all your needs, so thats why we want your email address. We ask your name so we
                        can start to populate your profile and also so we can address your properly.</p>
